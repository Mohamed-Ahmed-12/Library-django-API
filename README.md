# Library Django API

## Features
- **Book Management**: Add, view, and update books in the library.
- **Author Management**: Associate books with authors.
- **Favorite Books**: Users can add/remove books to/from their favorites list.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the user's favorite books, the system recommends similar books.
- **Search**: Users can search for books by title or author.
- **User Authentication**: Built-in user authentication for secure access.
