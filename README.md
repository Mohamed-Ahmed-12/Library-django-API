# Library Django API

This is a Django-based API for managing a library system. The API allows users to manage books, authors, and favorites. Users can also search for books, view book details, add books to their favorites, and receive recommendations based on their favorite books.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Add, view, and update books in the library.
- **Author Management**: Associate books with authors.
- **Favorite Books**: Users can add/remove books to/from their favorites list.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the user's favorite books, the system recommends similar books.
- **Search**: Users can search for books by title or author.
- **User Authentication**: Built-in user authentication for secure access.

To test the API, you can use Postman or any other API testing tool. Youâ€™ll need to include authentication headers (JWT token) for the routes that require authentication.
Example of Authorization (JWT):

    Login and get token: POST /api/token/obtain/
        Provide username and password.
        You will receive an access token and a refresh token.
    Use the access token to authorize API requests.
